## **3D Rotation Matrices**

This section explains the mathematics behind **3D rotation matrices** and how they are applied to rotate points in 3D space around the **X**, **Y**, and **Z** axes. Rotation matrices are fundamental for performing 3D transformations in computer graphics.

## **What is a Rotation Matrix?**

A **rotation matrix** is a matrix used to perform a **rotation** in Euclidean space. In 3D graphics, it transforms a point in 3D space by rotating it around one of the three principal axes (**X**, **Y**, or **Z**). The rotation is parameterized by an angle of rotation (Î¸), and each axis has its own corresponding rotation matrix.
